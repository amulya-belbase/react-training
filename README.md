# Vite + React + Typescript + ESLint + Prettier

I chose this template because it supports TypeScript, Vite, ESLint (which I'll probably use), and Prettier for formatting.

It's easy to install with no dependency issues.

If needed, I can add more dependencies later with no concern for redundant dependencies.

Use 'npm run dev' command to start the app.
